# Meteorites

## Overview
The following is a code that represents the placement and size of meteorites that have fallen to earth. I tinkered a lot with sizing and spacing to get as many on screen at a time while still trying to mimic the vastness of differences in the datta. In the end, I had a "low point" where all data would be the same size, allowing it to be readable.
